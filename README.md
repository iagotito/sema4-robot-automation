# Robot Order Automation - Automation Certification Level II

This repository contains the solution for the **Automation Certification Level II** course from [Sema4.ai](https://sema4.ai/docs/automation/courses/build-a-robot-python). This robot automates the process of ordering robots from RobotSpareBin Industries Inc.

## What This Robot Does

The robot performs the following automated tasks:

1. **Downloads order data** from a CSV file containing robot orders
2. **Opens the RobotSpareBin website** and navigates to the robot order page
3. **Processes each order** by:
   - Filling out the robot configuration form (head, body, legs, address)
   - Previewing the robot configuration
   - Submitting the order
   - Handling order confirmation
4. **Generates receipts** by:
   - Capturing the order receipt as HTML
   - Converting the receipt to PDF format
   - Taking a screenshot of the configured robot
   - Embedding the robot screenshot into the PDF receipt
5. **Archives all receipts** into a ZIP file for easy distribution

## Course Context

This project is part of the **Automation Certification Level II** curriculum, which focuses on building practical automation solutions using Python and the Robocorp framework. The course teaches advanced automation concepts including web automation, file processing, PDF generation, and data handling.

## Running

#### VS Code
1. Get [Robocorp Code](https://robocorp.com/docs/developer-tools/visual-studio-code/extension-features) -extension for VS Code.
1. You'll get an easy-to-use side panel and powerful command-palette commands for running, debugging, code completion, docs, etc.

#### Command line

1. [Get RCC](https://github.com/robocorp/rcc?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started)
1. Use the command: `rcc run`

## Results

üöÄ After running the bot, check out the `log.html` under the `output` -folder.

## Dependencies

We strongly recommend getting familiar with adding your dependencies in [conda.yaml](conda.yaml) to control your Python dependencies and the whole Python environment for your automation.

  <summary>üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è "Why not just pip install...?"</summary>

Think of [conda.yaml](conda.yaml) as an equivalent of the requirements.txt, but much better. üë©‚Äçüíª With `conda.yaml`, you are not just controlling your PyPI dependencies; you control the complete Python environment, which makes things repeatable and easy.

üëâ You will probably need to run your code on another machine quite soon, so by using `conda.yaml`:
- You can avoid `Works on my machine` -cases
- You do not need to manage Python installations on all the machines
- You can control exactly which version of Python your automation will run on 
  - You'll also control the pip version to avoid dep. resolution changes
- No need for venv, pyenv, ... tooling and knowledge sharing inside your team.
- Define dependencies in conda.yaml, let our tooling do the heavy lifting.
- You get all the content of [conda-forge](https://prefix.dev/channels/conda-forge) without any extra tooling

## What now?

üöÄ Now, go get'em

Start writing Python and remember that the AI/LLM's out there are getting really good and creating Python code specifically.
